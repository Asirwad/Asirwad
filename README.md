<h1>Asirwad Sali</h1>
<p><b>AI Engineer · Systems-minded</b></p>

<p>
I work on AI systems that are expected to run in production.<br/>
My focus is on correctness, cost, observability, and long-term maintainability.

## How I Approach AI Work

- Design **systems first**, models second  
- Prefer **simple, explicit architectures** over clever abstractions  
- Optimize for **debuggability, cost control, and failure modes**
- Treat AI components as **infrastructure**, not experiments

I’m still learning every day — especially where AI meets real-world constraints.

## Areas of Focus

**AI & LLM Systems**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (text & multimodal)
- Agentic workflows with deterministic execution
- Model routing, evaluation, and cost-aware inference
- Open-source + proprietary model tradeoffs

**Backend & Platform**
- Python, FastAPI, langgraph
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Docker, Kubernetes
- AWS / Azure
- Structured logging, metrics, traces

**Product Engineering**
- Building internal AI platforms teams can trust
- Clear APIs, versioning, and operational discipline
- Frontends only when they serve the system (Next.js)

## Selected Work (Ongoing / Iterative)

| Project | What it explores |
|------|------------------|
| **RAG Pipeline Optimizer** | Comparing RAG configurations to understand accuracy vs cost tradeoffs |
| **Cost-Control Model Router** | Routing prompts to the least expensive capable model |
| **Multimodal Video RAG** | Searching visual moments in long-form video using VLMs |

These projects are built to understand **tradeoffs**, not to chase benchmarks.

I value clarity over cleverness, and systems that age well.
